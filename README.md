# AI-Assisted Coding Framework

A comprehensive workflow framework that enhances GitHub Copilot with persistent memory, documentation RAG, and advanced AI agent capabilities for software development projects.

## üöÄ Overview

This framework integrates two powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to supercharge your development workflow:

- **Context7 MCP**: Provides live documentation and code snippet retrieval for authoritative technical references
- **ConPort MCP**: Delivers persistent project memory, decision tracking, and knowledge graph capabilities

Together, they transform GitHub Copilot into an intelligent development assistant that remembers project context, tracks architectural decisions, and maintains comprehensive project knowledge across sessions.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (required for ConPort MCP server)
- **Node.js 16+** (for Context7 MCP server)
- **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extension
- **Git** for version control

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone and Copy Framework Files

```powershell
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/seiggy/AI-Assisted-Coding.git
cd AI-Assisted-Coding

# Copy all framework files to your project's root directory
# Replace 'your-project-path' with the actual path to your project
Copy-Item -Path ".\*" -Destination "C:\path\to\your-project\" -Recurse -Force
```

### Step 2: Python Environment Setup

Navigate to your project directory and set up the Python virtual environment:

```powershell
# Create Python virtual environment (using uv)
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Verify activation (you should see (.venv) in your prompt)
```

### Step 3: Install ConPort MCP Server

With your virtual environment activated, install the ConPort MCP server:

```powershell
# Using uv (recommended for faster installs)
uv pip install context-portal-mcp
```

### Step 4: Open Project in VS Code

```powershell
# Open your project in VS Code
code .
```
### Step 5: Update Your Project Brief

Before proceeding, open `projectBrief.md` in your project root. Follow the guidelines at the bottom of that file to describe your project's goals, architecture, and any relevant details. This ensures the AI agent has accurate context for your specific project.

### Step 6: Verify GitHub Copilot Integration

1. Ensure GitHub Copilot extension is installed and activated
2. The framework will automatically detect the `copilot-instructions.md` file


### Step 7: Initialize ConPort MCP

After verifying Copilot integration, initialize the ConPort MCP memory system:

1. In the Copilot chat or comments, type:  
    ```
    Initialize ConPort
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to complete setup.  
    This step creates the persistent memory database and loads your project context before you start coding.

### Step 8: Start Coding!

Using the core workflow commands below, start your coding! We recommend starting with an ArchReview to analyze the project first, and get the AI's recommendations for next steps.

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and reuse successful patterns across the project
- **Knowledge Graph**: Link related concepts, decisions, and implementations

### Intelligent Context
- **Active Context**: Maintains current focus and recent changes
- **Product Context**: Stores high-level project information and goals
- **Historical Learning**: Applies lessons learned from past development cycles
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Remembers context between VS Code sessions

### Architecture Documentation & Diagrams

The framework automatically generates and maintains visual architecture documentation using Mermaid diagrams stored in the `architectureDiagrams/` folder.

#### ArchReview Command
The `ArchReview` command performs comprehensive analysis of your system architecture:

- **Current State Analysis**: Evaluates existing code structure against documented architecture
- **Scalability Assessment**: Identifies potential bottlenecks for data volume, traffic, and fault-tolerance
- **Completeness Check**: Detects missing diagram types and architectural components
- **Gap Identification**: Compares implementation progress with architectural decisions
- **Recommendation Generation**: Provides actionable suggestions for architectural improvements

#### Auto-Generated Diagram Types

The framework creates and maintains multiple diagram types in `architectureDiagrams/`:

**System Overview** (`system_overview.md`)
```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'dark'}}%%
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|HTTPS| B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[App Service]
    C --> D[(Database)]
```

**Sequence Diagrams** - Show interaction flows between components
**State Diagrams** - Document component states and transitions
**Data Flow Diagrams** - Illustrate information movement through the system
**Infrastructure Diagrams** - Map deployment and hosting architecture
**UML Class Diagrams** - Detail object relationships and inheritance

#### Diagram Management

**Automatic Creation**: Diagrams are generated during `ArchUpdate` commands based on:
- Code analysis and structure detection
- Architectural decisions logged in ConPort
- Implementation progress and patterns
- System complexity and component relationships

**Manual Editing**: You can manually edit any diagram files to:
- Refine architectural representation
- Add business logic documentation
- Include deployment specifications
- Clarify component relationships

**AI Reference**: The AI continuously references these diagrams to:
- Maintain architectural consistency during implementation
- Validate new features against existing design
- Suggest improvements based on current structure
- Ensure code changes align with documented architecture

#### Workflow Integration

```
ArchReview
```
**Generates comprehensive analysis report with recommendations**

```
ArchUpdate: Implement database optimization patterns
```
**Creates/updates relevant diagrams based on the changes**

The AI uses these visual representations as a "source of truth" for architectural understanding, ensuring that all code generation and modifications remain consistent with your intended system design. Regular review and updates of these diagrams help maintain architectural integrity throughout the development lifecycle.

### üìè Custom AI Guidance: Instructions and Prompts

To further tailor the AI's behavior and provide reusable patterns for common tasks, the framework includes specialized folders within the `.github` directory: `.github/instructions` and `.github/prompts`. These files are written in Markdown and are designed to be easily customized by developers.

#### Instructions (`.github/instructions/`)

This directory contains a collection of instruction files that provide generic "rules" and best practices for the AI to follow when working with specific frameworks, languages, or scenarios. They help ensure consistency and adherence to established guidelines.

**Purpose:**
- Define coding standards for different technologies.
- Outline best practices for specific development tasks (e.g., performance optimization, security).
- Guide the AI on how to approach problems within a particular framework.

**Available Instruction Files:**
- `aspire.instructions.md`: Guidelines for working with .NET Aspire.
- `blazor.instructions.md`: Best practices for Blazor development with .NET 9.
- `csharp.instructions.md`: C# specific coding conventions and rules.
- `docker.instructions.md`: Instructions for creating and managing Dockerfiles and Docker images.
- `python.instructions.md`: Python specific coding conventions and best practices.
- `react.instructions.md`: Best practices for React development.
- `typescript.instructions.md`: TypeScript specific coding conventions and best practices.

These files serve as excellent starting points and can be expanded or modified to fit your project's specific needs and conventions.

#### Prompts (`.github/prompts/`)

This directory houses prompt files that contain detailed, step-by-step instructions for the AI on how to perform a specific task in a structured manner. They act as templates for complex operations, ensuring the AI asks the right questions and follows a consistent workflow.

**Purpose:**
- Expand simple user requests into a series of actionable steps for the AI.
- Guide the AI through complex code generation tasks (e.g., creating a new component).
- Ensure all necessary information is gathered before the AI proceeds with a task.

**Available Prompt Files:**
- `blazor-component.prompt.md`: A detailed prompt for generating new Blazor components, including requirements gathering, best practice adherence, and testing suggestions.

Developers can customize these prompts or create new ones to automate repetitive tasks or to ensure a standardized approach to common development activities.

These instruction and prompt files are powerful tools for shaping the AI's behavior, improving the quality of its output, and streamlining your development process.
